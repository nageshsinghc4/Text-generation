# Text-generation

## Text generation using Markov's Chain.

The repository conatins code to build a text generator using **Markov chains**. This will be a character based model that takes the previous character of the chain and generates the next letter in the sequence.

By training our program with sample words, our text generator will learn common patterns in character order. The text generator will then apply these patterns to the input, an incomplete word, and output the character with the highest probability to complete that word.
